# midiSynth
this is a basic midi synthesizer that uses the computer keyboard in conjunction with the java midi library to produce different notes.
currently it only plays the default piano sound and selecting other sounds is weird and im still trying to figure it out.
it has about an octave and a half of notes, octave up down controls, note length toggle, sustain pedal, and a velocity toggle.
there are also a bunch of test classes for playing sound clips etc. that were never finished.
